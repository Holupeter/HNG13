# Contact Us and About Me Pages - Profile Card Project

This project is an extension of the **Profile Card** web page, where we've added two new pages: **Contact Us** and **About Me**. The Contact Us page includes a form with validation, while the About Me page provides reflections and personal thoughts.

The application uses semantic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and a clean user experience.

## Features

- **Profile Card Page**: Displays a profile card with personal details, avatar, hobbies, and dislikes.
- **Contact Us Page**: A form with validation, including fields for full name, email, subject, and message. A success message is displayed upon successful form submission.
- **About Me Page**: A reflective page where users can read about the bio, goals, areas of low confidence, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS**: Responsive layout with Flexbox, custom styles to match the purple theme.
- **JavaScript**: Form validation, time display, and interactivity using vanilla JavaScript.
